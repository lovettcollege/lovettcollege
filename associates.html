Associates serve as a resource for Lovett students, offering mentorship, academic and career advice, and some even play on Lovett’s intramural sports teams! (Fun fact: Lovett is the only residential college to have a former U.S. president serve as an associate, and we have the only Nobel Prize-winning associate too!) Lovett’s Associates program is coordinated by three elected student Associates coordinators. They organize events to facilitate interaction between Lovett students and Associates including semesterly Associates nights, Finals study breaks, and Senior Wine & Cheese tasting. <br> <br>

If you are interested in becoming a Lovett Associate, please email our college coordinator Sharon O’Leary <a href= mailto:sko1@rice.edu>sko1@rice.edu</a> for the application!

Professor Hirasaki joined the Rice faculty after a 26 year career with Shell Development and Shell Oil Company. His research in fluid transport through porous media ranged from the microscopic scale intermolecular forces governing wettability to the megascopic scale numerical reservoir simulators for field-wide modeling. A reoccurring theme throughout this research is the dominance of interfaces in the determination of fluid transport processes. Fluids flow through rock and soil in pore spaces that are on the order of microns. The relative transport of phases and components are governed by the degree of wetting of the solid by the fluid phases and the sorption of species on the fluid and solid surfaces in addition to the usual transport coefficients such as viscosity and diffusivity.  Professor Hirasaki's research program is sponsored by an industrial consortium, USDOE, and industrial contracts.
Darlene Hirasaki sits on the board of the The Society of Rice University Women (SRUW) and a community volunteer.
They are both adventurous world travelers who particularly love mountains. </p>

Johnson is a Professor of Computer Science and of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University and was previously a member of the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University for eight years. He received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science in 1990 from Rice University. Professor Johnson founded and is leading the Monarch (MObile Networking ARCHitectures) research group at Rice (previously at Carnegie Mellon) and has worked substantially on the problems of Mobile IP and different types of multihop wireless networking such as mobile ad hoc networking, sensor networking, and mesh networking. He was very active in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the principal protocol standards development body for the Internet.

I attended an accelerated program in which I completed 62 hours in less than two years while working full time with twin daughters still in high school.  After that, I decided to keep on and received my masters as well.  I actually retired from the community college after 32 years and then began my second career here at Rice.  In addition to my position at Rice, I currently teach part-time at the community college and I always tell my students that I am the poster child for “It’s Never Too Late!”
